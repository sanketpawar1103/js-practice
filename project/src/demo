Hi Jayanth, 
Karthik and I are exploring hashing individually. While discussing  
we got to know that we are exploring two different areas.
Hash Tables for data indexing and Cryptographic Hashing for secure, irreversible data conversion.
We wanted to clarify if we should focus on one specific area or explore both.
Important note that, I have started with data structure one, And on the other hand, Karthik started with Cryptographic one.
